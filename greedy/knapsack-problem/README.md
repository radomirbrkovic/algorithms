# Knapsack Problem

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine a subset of items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. 

The knapsack problem is in combinatorial optimization problem. It appears as a subproblem in many more complex mathematical models of real-word problems. One general approach to difficult problems is to identify he most restrictive constant, ignore the others, solve a knapsack problem, and somehow adjust the solution to satisfy the ignored constant.
