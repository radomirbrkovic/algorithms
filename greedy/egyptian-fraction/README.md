# Greedy Algorithm for Egyptian Fraction

Every positive fraction can be represented as sum of unique unit fractions. A fractions is unit fraction if numerator is 1 and denominator is a positive integer, for example 1/3 is a unit fraction. Such a representation is called **Egyptian Fraction** as it was used by ancient Egyptians. 

Following are few examples:

```
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 2/3 is 1/2 + 1/6
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156
```

We can generate Egyptian Fractions by greedy algorithm. For a given number of rhe form `nr/dr` where `dr > nr`, first find greatest possible unit fractions, then recur for the remaining part. For example, consider 6/14, we first find ceiling of 14/6, i.e., 3. So the first unit fraction becomes 1/3, then recur for (6/14 â€“ 1/3) i.e., 4/42.
