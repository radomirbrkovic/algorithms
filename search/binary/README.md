# Binary search

**Binary search** is the most popular Search algorithm. It is efficient and also one of the most commonly used techniques that is used to solve problems.

Binary search works only on a sorted set of elements. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must first be sorted.

When binary search is used to perform operations on a sorted set, the number of iterations can always be reduced on the basis of the value that is being searched. Because of dividing the list on half in each iteration, the execution time needed for binary search is  **O(logN)** (in Big O notation).
