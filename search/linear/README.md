# Linear searching algorithm 

**Linear searching algorithm** is the simplest searching algorithm for implementing. Base strategy is  traversing a list from start to end by exploring properties of all the elements that are found on the way. In the worst case scenario execution time for this algorithm is  **O(N)** (time in Big O notation), so the best practice is use it for small data sets.
