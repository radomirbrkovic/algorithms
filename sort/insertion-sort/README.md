# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm in which the elements are transferred one at a time to the right position. In other words, an insertion sort helps in building the final sorted list, one item at a time, with the movement of higher-ranked elements. An insertion sort has the benefits of simplicity and low overhead. In worst case necessary time for running  insertion sort algorithm is **O(N)** (time in Big O notation) so the best practice is use it for small data sets.
