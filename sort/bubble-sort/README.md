# Bubble sort

**Bubble sort** is the simplest and slowest sorting algorithm. It designed to took max value and push it on top top of the list through iterations. Base logic of bubble sort algorithm is to compare tow adjacent elements of array and replacing positions if they are disordered.
 
Bubble sort is easiest for implementation but it's also slowest algorithm **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** (time in Big O notation) so the best practice is use it for small data sets.
