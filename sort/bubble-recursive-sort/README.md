# Recursive Bubble sort | [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-bubble-sort/)

**Recursive bubble sort** doesn't have any performance/implementation advantages then classic **bubble sort algorithm**,  but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Bubble Sort and recursion.

If we take a closer look at Bubble Sort algorithm, we can notice that in first pass, we move largest element to end (Assuming sorting in increasing order). In second pass, we move second largest element to second last position and so on.
