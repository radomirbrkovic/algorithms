# Heap

**Heap** is a special Three-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.  Generally, Heap can be one of two types:
 1. **Max-heap**: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
 2. **Min-heap**: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
