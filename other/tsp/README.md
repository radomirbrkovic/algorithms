# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest yet most efficient route for a person to take given a list of specific destinations. It is a well-known algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research.

For practice purpose we cover two possible solutions of this problem:

- **Brute force** (`brute_force_tsp.py`) which calculate all possible ruts permutations and returns the shortest.
- **Greed algorithm** (`greed_tsp_tsp.py`) which in every iteration get nearest node which is not visited and returns given root.
